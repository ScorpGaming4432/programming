# Programming 
## Quick Summary
this repository is mainly used for tracking my progress in coding
what i'm going to have here is based completely on my preference and what i think should be here
## So what's actually here?
Well, my journey will probs be random codes in random languages (for now, mainly python) but if i'll care enough i'll update the codes with some description or whatever
## Why even do this?

 1. cos.
 2. i actually wanted to have my code on the internet so i can access my code from anywhere i want
 3. ~~easier cheating on tests~~
## anyways i wanna thank github for existing
~~also my soul for not abandoning me and me for not killing myself while programming~~
**

**ANYWAY HAVE FUN LOOKING AT MY CODE AND FIGURING OUT MOST STUFF**
